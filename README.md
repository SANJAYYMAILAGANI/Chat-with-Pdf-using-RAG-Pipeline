# Chat-with-Pdf-using-RAG-Pipeline
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for interacting with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system will extract relevant information from these files, segment it into manageable chunks, and convert these chunks into embeddings for efficient retrieval.
